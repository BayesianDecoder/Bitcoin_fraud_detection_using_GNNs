# ₿ Bitcoin Transaction Analysis using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Bitcoin transaction data** using machine learning and data visualization techniques to uncover trends, correlations, and potential predictive insights in blockchain-based financial activity.  
It demonstrates how data science can be applied to **cryptocurrency analytics**, highlighting the importance of transparency, anomaly detection, and behavioral finance in decentralized systems.

## 📊 Objectives
- Explore and visualize Bitcoin transaction datasets.
- Understand the distribution of transaction sizes, fees, and timestamps.
- Apply basic **machine learning** or **statistical techniques** for pattern recognition.
- Build a foundation for **fraud detection**, **fee optimization**, or **market activity prediction**.

## 🧩 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load raw Bitcoin transaction CSV/JSON datasets.
   - Handle missing or invalid entries.
   - Convert timestamps and normalize numeric features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize transaction volume over time.
   - Identify outliers in transaction amounts and fees.
   - Explore correlations between input/output counts, size, and fees.

3. **Modeling**
   - Apply clustering or regression models to detect patterns.
   - Use correlation matrices or PCA to reduce dimensionality.
   - Optional: Implement anomaly detection to flag unusual transactions.

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Create temporal charts for transaction frequency and volume trends.

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- Transaction fees and sizes often exhibit **heavy-tailed distributions**.
- Transaction counts correlate with **network congestion periods**.
- Anomalies in transaction graphs can hint at **suspicious activities** or **whale movements**.
- Machine learning models can help in **predicting transaction fees** or **detecting unusual flows**.
